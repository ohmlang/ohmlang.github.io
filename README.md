# About

This repo hosts the generated (post-build) assets for [ohmjs.org][] in the `gh-pages` branch. The source for the site is now at [ohmjs/ohmjs.org][].

**NOTE**: Do NOT delete this repo! [ohmlang.github.io][] used to be the official Ohm site, and some published papers use that URL. As long as this repo is around, GitHub will 301 redirect to whatever is in the [CNAME file](https://github.com/ohmlang/ohmlang.github.io/blob/gh-pages/CNAME).
