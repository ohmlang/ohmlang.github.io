We are interested in improving the experience of prototyping and implementing programming languages.
In this paper, we outline some ways in which principles from live programming could make the life
of the “language hacker” easier, and introduce novel visualizations that manifest the normally
opaque semantics of parsing and semantic actions. We demonstrate the application of these ideas in
the Ohm Editor, a tool we are building to support our new
<a href="https://github.com/cdglabs/ohm">language implementation framework</a>, but we believe they are
equally applicable to other language-hacking tools.

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Live programming environments [<a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/61549">Hancock 2003</a>] enable
programmers to better understand their code (even while they are writing or modifying it), catch and
fix bugs earlier, and more. Much of this power comes from giving programmers support for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>visualizing the execution</strong> of their programs
[<a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">Victor 2012b</a>],</li>
<li><strong>continuous feedback</strong> to see the effects of their changes instantly
[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLrdhFEAiqo">McDirmid 2015</a>], and</li>
<li>writing code in the context of example inputs, to <strong>make programming more concrete</strong>
[<a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">Victor 2012a</a>].</li>
</ul>
<p>We are interested in bringing the benefits of live programming to the domain of programming
language prototyping and implementation. In this paper, we outline some ways in which the principles
above could make the life of the “language hacker” easier. We demonstrate the application of
these principles in the Ohm Editor, a tool we are building to support our new
<a href="https://github.com/cdglabs/ohm">language implementation framework</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ohm at a glance.</strong> Ohm builds on parsing expression grammars (PEGs)
[<a href="http://www.brynosaurus.com/pub/lang/peg.pdf">Ford 2004</a>] to give language designers and
implementers a convenient way to prototype programming languages, i.e., write parsers, interpreters,
compilers, etc. An Ohm <em>grammar</em> defines the syntax of a language, while <em>semantic actions</em> specify
what to do with them. Unlike most other grammar-based tools — e.g., OMeta
[<a href="http://www.tinlizzie.org/~awarth/papers/dls07.pdf">Warth and Piumarta 2007</a>] and Yacc
[<a href="http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/">Johnson 1975</a>] — Ohm completely separates grammars and
semantic actions. This separation improves modularity, and makes both grammars and semantic actions
easier to read and understand.</p>
<p>In grammar-based tools like Ohm and Yacc, the programmer writes grammars as well as semantic
actions. While these are distinct activities that should be supported in different ways, the live
programming principles above apply to both of them.</p>
<p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the Ohm Editor.
Sections 3 and 4 describe how we applied principles from live programming to improve the experience
of writing grammars and semantic actions, respectively. Section 5 presents some ongoing work
that we plan to present at the LIVE workshop, and Section 6 concludes.</p>
<h2 id="2-overview-of-the-ohm-editor">2. Overview of the Ohm Editor</h2>
<p>Below is a screenshot of the Ohm Editor, with a sample grammar of arithmetic expressions:</p>
<p><img src="media/editor-overview.png" width="768"></p>
<p>The editor consists of three panes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>grammar editor</strong> (top left),</li>
<li>the list of <strong>examples</strong> (top right) that serve as test cases for developing and debugging the
grammar, and</li>
<li>the <strong>visualizer</strong> (bottom half), which shows how the selected example was parsed.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following two sections, we show how these components come together to provide a powerful
environment for writing grammars and semantic actions.</p>
<h2 id="3-live-editing-grammars">3. Live Editing Grammars</h2>
<p>Both the grammar pane and the examples pane are “live” and offer continuous feedback to the user as
they type. In this section, we will describe this feedback and how it helps the user develop,
debug, and understand grammars.</p>
<h3 id="editing-examples">Editing Examples</h3>
<p>As the user types in the example pane, the Ohm Editor continuously tries to match the example
against the grammar. If it does not match the example successfully, a portion of the text is
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #C7254E;">underlined in red</span> to indicate where the
error occurred. This is deliberately subtle so as to avoid interrupting the user while they are
still typing. Once the user stops typing, if the text still fails to match, an error is shown after
a brief delay:</p>
<p><img src="media/example-error.png" alt="Screenshot of error in input editor" width="768"></p>
<p>If the example matches successfully, the resulting <em>concrete syntax tree</em> (CST) is shown in the
visualizer pane. The visualizer is described in detail below.</p>
<h3 id="editing-grammars">Editing Grammars</h3>
<p>When editing a grammar, there are a few forms of feedback that are relevant. First, it is useful to
know whether the examples still match the grammar. Each example in the examples pane has a green or
red indicator that shows whether or not it is accepted by the grammar:</p>
<p><img src="media/example-indicators.png" width="768"></p>
<p>As the user types, the editor continously tries to match each example against the current version
of the grammar, appropriately updating the indicators either red or green. In this way, the Ohm
Editor supports a basic form of “example-centric programming”, where the grammar can be developed
in the context of a number of concrete examples. Rather than beginning with a grammar, the
programmer may choose to start by writing one or more examples, and then develop the grammar to
work with these examples.</p>
<p>Another form of feedback is provided when editing grammars: as the user types, the editor
continuously checks that the grammar itself is syntactically valid. Just like in the example editor,
any error is initially indicated with a dashed red line and, after a brief delay, a complete error
message is shown:</p>
<p><img src="media/grammar-error.png" alt="Screenshot of error in input editor" width="768"></p>
<h3 id="visualizer">Visualizer</h3>
<p>When the selected example is accepted by the grammar, the Ohm Editor’s visualizer displays a
<em>concrete syntax tree</em> (CST) that represents the syntactic structure of the input, as defined by
the grammar. Below is the CST of the input <code>3 + (4 * 5)</code>:</p>
<p><img src="media/example-parse-tree.png" width="442"></p>
<p>This visualization is a variation on an <em>icicle plot</em>
[<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2685881?seq=1">Kruskal and Landwehr 1983</a>]. It is also similar to a
<a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">flame graph</a>, which is often used in software
profilers.</p>
<p>Nodes representing successful rule applications (e.g., <code>Exp</code> and <code>AddExp</code>) are depicted by
<span style="background-color: #efefef; padding: 0 4px; display: inline-block;">gray
rectangles</span> and labeled with the name of the associated rule. Nodes that represent
successfully-matched string literals, e.g., <code>&quot;+&quot;</code>,  are shown <span style="color: SeaGreen;">in
green</span>.</p>
<p>This visualization shares two important properties with typical icicle plots:</p>
<ul>
<li>A node’s children appear immediately beneath it. In this example, the <cstnode>Exp</cstnode> node
at the top level has a single child: an <cstnode>AddExp</cstnode> node.</li>
<li>The width of the node carries information. In this case, it shows how much of the input text was
consumed by that node. More specifically, the text consumed by a node appears directly above it.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the cursor is over a node, the portion of text consumed by that node is highlighted:</p>
<video controls>
  <source src="media/consumed-input.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>Our visualization differs from a standard icicle plot in at least two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The horizontal position of a node is important — it always lines up with the text consumed by
that node.</li>
<li>The width of the nodes is <strong>not</strong> determined by a linear scale; their relative widths are not
comparable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for the latter point is that in order to keep the node labels readable, we ensure that
each node is always at least as wide as its label. If necessary, we increase the letter spacing of
the consumed input text to maintain the invariant that the text consumed by a node always appears
directly above the node.</p>
<p>Since parse trees can get quite large, we enable the user to restrict the amount of information on screen by
collapsing the children of some nodes. 
A <span style="background-color: #efefef; padding: 0 4px; border-bottom: 1px solid #bbb">dark gray bottom
border</span> — as in the <cstnode style="border-bottom: 1px solid #bbb;">number</cstnode> nodes in this
example — indicate collapsed nodes. The user can collapse and expand any node by clicking on it:</p>
<video controls>
  <source src="media/showing-hiding-nodes.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<h4 id="visualizing-failed-parses">Visualizing Failed Parses</h4>
<p>When an input fails to match, it does not produce a parse tree. However, it is still helpful
to give the programmer some insight into why the parse failed. For this purpose, our visualizer
supports a “show failures” option. Here is an example of parsing the invalid input <code>90% * 1000</code>:</p>
<p><img src="media/show-failures.png" width="442"></p>
<p>In this mode, the visualization has the same structure as before: successful rule applications are
gray, and align with the input that they consumed. But this structure is augmented with information
about failed expressions, which are shown in <span style="color: #d44950">red</span>. Note that in
practice, most parses (successful or not) consist of both successfully-matched expressions and
failures.</p>
<p>To clarify the meaning of our “show failures” visualization, the image below shows the
correspondence between the children of the <cstnode>AddExp</cstnode> node and their definitions in
the arithmetic grammar. Our user interface lets the programmer see these connections by highlighting
the corresponding definition in the grammar pane (not shown) when the mouse hovers over one of the
nodes in the visualization.</p>
<p><img src="media/show-failures-annotated.png" width="768">
<!-- <img src="media/show-failures-hover.png" width="768"> --></p>
<p>So in the process of recognizing the input as an <cstnode>AddExp</cstnode>, we can see that the
parser attempts the folowing:</p>
<ol>
<li><cstnode>AddExp<caselabel>plus</caselabel></cstnode>, which fails;</li>
<li><cstnode>AddExp<caselabel>minus</caselabel></cstnode>, which also fails; and finally</li>
<li><cstnode>MulExp</cstnode>, which succeeds, consuming the substring <code>90</code> from the input stream.</li>
</ol>
<p>When read from top to bottom and left to right, our “show failures” visualization shows each step
that the grammar took in recognizing (or attempting to recognize) the input. Essentially, it
“unrolls” the entire computation into a single, browseable structure. Unlike a stepping debugger,
this visualization abstracts over time — it is one step higher on the ladder of abstraction
[<a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Victor 2011</a>].</p>
<h2 id="4-live-editing-semantic-actions">4. Live Editing Semantic Actions</h2>
<p>In Ohm, a grammar determines the set of all valid inputs in a language, but it does not specify
what to do with them. To do something other than recognize valid inputs, e.g., to generate an
abstract syntax tree or interpret a program, the programmer must first create a <em>semantics</em> for
that grammar. A semantics is a collection of operations and attributes for a given grammar.</p>
<p>This section outlines the Ohm Editor’s support for creating and editing operations and attributes.
Our running example will be an “eval” operation that computes the value of an arithmetic expression.</p>
<h3 id="example-driven-development">Example-Driven Development</h3>
<p>When the programmer creates an operation, they must specify how it behaves for each rule in the
grammar. This is done by writing semantic actions. To make the task of writing semantic actions
less tedious and abstract, and to shorten the feedback loop between the programmer and the computer,
the Ohm Editor allows semantic actions to be written in the context of an example. The following
sections illustrate how the Ohm Editor leverages examples to improve the experience of writing
semantic actions.</p>
<h3 id="writing-semantic-actions-top-down">Writing Semantic Actions Top-Down</h3>
<p>Ohm evaluates operations in a top-down fashion. When the user adds a new operation to a semantics,
it starts out without any semantic actions. In the video below, we see that the Ohm Editor helpfully
points out what (if any) semantic actions still need to be specified before it can compute a result
for the current input. This is similar to the “bookkeeping” provided by the
<a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq proof assistant</a>.</p>
<video controls>
  <source src="media/top-down-with-next-steps.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>Here, the programmer adds an operation called “eval” and the Ohm Editor points out that the first
CST node that is missing a semantic action, from a top-down perspective,
is <cstnode>AddExp<caselabel>plus</caselabel></cstnode>.</p>
<p>The programmer then adds the semantic action for <cstnode>AddExp<caselabel>plus</caselabel></cstnode>. This is
done by giving names to the sub-expressions corresponding to the operands and specifying how to compute the result
recursively: to evaluate a “plus” node, first evaluate each of its operands, then return the sum of
the results. Note that this semantic action applies to all <cstnode>AddExp<caselabel>plus</caselabel></cstnode>
nodes, not just the one in this example.</p>
<p>At this point, the Ohm Editor attempts to compute the value of the “eval” operation for the current
input and finds the next set of semantic actions that are missing: <cstnode>number</cstnode>
and <cstnode>MulExp<caselabel>times</caselabel></cstnode>. The following video shows what happens when the
programmer adds the missing semantic actions.</p>
<video controls>
  <source src="media/top-down-with-next-steps-cont.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>Note that the value of the “eval” operation is shown immediately for each node, as an extension of
the visualization described the previous section.</p>
<h3 id="improving-top-down-development-by-zooming">Improving Top-Down Development by Zooming</h3>
<p>Writing semantic actions in a top-down style, as shown in the previous section, often requires the
programmer to write several semantic actions before they can finally see a result. This goes against
the principle of continuous feedback; it would be better if the programmer could see the effects of
the code that they are writing (e.g., the semantic action for <cstnode>AddExp<caselabel>plus</caselabel></cstnode>)
instantly.</p>
<p>To make writing semantic actions a more reactive experience, the Ohm Editor supports a “zoom” feature that enables
the programmer to focus on a sub-expression, write the semantic actions that are required to compute
its value, and then zoom out to think about the bigger picture:</p>
<video controls>
  <source src="media/top-down-with-zoom.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>Note that after the programmer zooms out, the operation’s value for the sub-expression <code>2 * 3</code> is
shown in the visualization of the top-level expression. This provides a useful context for
writing the semantic action for <cstnode>AddExp<caselabel>plus</caselabel></cstnode> (not shown).</p>
<p>Also note that the programmer in this video had to write two semantic actions (the ones
for <cstnode>MulExp<caselabel>times</caselabel></cstnode> and <cstnode>number</cstnode>) before any
results were shown; this falls short of the live programming experience we are after.
One way to get more immediate feedback in this example is to first zoom in on a <cstnode>number</cstnode> and
write its semantic action, then zoom in on its parent <cstnode>MulExp<caselabel>times</caselabel></cstnode> and
write that semantic action. The next section provides a different solution to this problem.</p>
<h3 id="writing-semantic-actions-bottom-up">Writing Semantic Actions Bottom-Up</h3>
<p>When the programmer modifies or adds a semantic action through a particular CST node, the value of
that node is automatically recomputed. The Ohm Editor also enables programmers to force the
evaluation of an operation, for any node that has an associated semantic action, at any time.</p>
<p>Combined, these features enable programmers to write semantic actions in a bottom-up fashion:</p>
<video controls>
  <source src="media/bottom-up.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>This bottom-up development style has distinct advantages from a live programming perspective, as it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provides a more helpful context for writing semantic actions</strong>. For example, when the programmer writes
the semantic action for the <cstnode>MulExp<caselabel>times</caselabel></cstnode> node, they can see the
results of the semantic actions on the child nodes. This makes programming more concrete.</li>
<li><strong>Gives the programmer immediate feedback</strong>, i.e.,  they get to see the value that is produced by a semantic
action immediately after writing it. This gives the programmer confidence that their code is correct, and when it
isn’t, enables them to catch and fix bugs right away.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="visualizing-intermediate-results">Visualizing Intermediate Results</h3>
<div style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 15px;">
<video controls class="float-right" style="width: 50%">
  <source src="media/visualizing-every-step-of-computation.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>
At any point during the development of an operation, the Ohm Editor can serve as a “playground”
that enables the programmer to interactively modify the input and see immediately how their changes
affect the result. Our interface naturally supports incremental development: if the programmer
enters an input that is not yet supported by the operation, they will immediately see what semantic
actions are missing and may add those right then and there (in the appropriate context) if desired.
</p>

<p>
The ability to visualize intermediate results is helpful for understanding and debugging an
operation. It enables the programmer to see how the “ingredients are combined” to make a “delicious
soufflé” [<a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/#flow">Victor 2012b</a>]. Our visualization of
intermediate results was inspired in part by a prototype attribute grammar editor that was done by
Akira Sasaki while he was a visitor at the Communications Design Group (CDG), and Glen Chiacchieri’s
<a href="http://glench.com/LegibleMathematics/">Legible Mathematics</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="5-ongoing-work">5. Ongoing Work</h2>
<p>This section describes some ongoing work that we plan to demonstrate at the LIVE workshop.</p>
<h3 id="-mad-libs-based-automatic-input-generation">“Mad Libs”-based Automatic Input Generation</h3>
<video controls class="float-right" style="width: 50%">
  <source src="media/madlibs.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>We are currently working on extending the Ohm Editor with support for automatically generating
inputs that are valid according to a user-defined grammar. We hope this will give the programmer a
better understanding of the language they are working on (even while editing the grammar) and
enable them to catch bugs earlier than with traditional tools.</p>
<p>Our prototype leverages a set of user-supplied examples (see
<a href="#3-live-editing-grammars">Section 3</a>) to generate new inputs with a
&ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs">Mad Libs</a>&rdquo;-style algorithm. As an example,
consider the problem of generating a valid input for our arithmetic
grammar’s <cstnode>MulExp<caselabel>times</caselabel></cstnode> rule:</p>
<pre><code>  MulExp
    = MulExp &quot;*&quot; PriExp  -- times
    | ...
</code></pre><p>Here is the Mad Libs equivalent of this rule:</p>
<div class="clearfix"><!-- Break out of float --></div>

<p><img src="media/madlibs-white.png" width="768"></p>
<p>To generate a valid input for <cstnode>MulExp<caselabel>times</caselabel></cstnode>, all we need is
a valid input for <cstnode>MulExp</cstnode>, and a valid input for <cstnode>PriExp</cstnode>. The
main insight of our algorithm is that there is no need to generate strings for these sub-expressions
when we can simply “mine” them from the set of user-supplied examples. This leads to more
“natural-looking” examples than those produced by purely generative algorithms, e.g., in
Petit Parser [<a href="http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Reng10cDynamicGrammars.pdf">Renggli et al. 2010</a>].</p>
<p>Note that the user does not have to enter examples for each of these rules explicitly. A single
user-supplied example, such as <code>1 * 2 + 3</code>, actually contains several sub-examples. These
sub-examples are determined by the decomposition of the example according to the grammar:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>1 * 2 + 3</code> is an <cstnode>Exp</cstnode>, an <cstnode>AddExp</cstnode>, and
an <cstnode>AddExp<caselabel>plus</caselabel></cstnode></li>
<li><code>1 * 2</code> is an <cstnode>AddExp</cstnode>, a <cstnode>MulExp</cstnode>, and
a <cstnode>MulExp<caselabel>times</caselabel></cstnode></li>
<li><code>1</code> is a <cstnode>MulExp</cstnode>, a <cstnode>PriExp</cstnode>,
a <cstnode>number</cstnode>, and a <cstnode>digit</cstnode></li>
<li><code>2</code> is a <cstnode>PriExp</cstnode>, a <cstnode>Number</cstnode>, and a <cstnode>digit</cstnode></li>
<li><code>3</code> is a <cstnode>MulExp</cstnode>, a <cstnode>PriExp</cstnode>, a <cstnode>number</cstnode>, and
a <cstnode>digit</cstnode></li>
</ul>
<p>Fueled by this (single) user-supplied example, our Mad Libs algorithm can generate any of the
following inputs for <cstnode>MulExp<caselabel>times</caselabel></cstnode>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><img src="media/mulexp-priexp.png"></th>
<th>1</th>
<th>2</th>
<th>3</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><code>1</code> <code>*</code> <code>1</code></td>
<td><code>1</code> <code>*</code> <code>2</code></td>
<td><code>1</code> <code>*</code> <code>3</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><code>3</code> <code>*</code> <code>1</code></td>
<td><code>3</code> <code>*</code> <code>2</code></td>
<td><code>3</code> <code>*</code> <code>3</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 * 2</td>
<td><code>1 * 2</code> <code>*</code> <code>1</code></td>
<td><code>1 * 2</code> <code>*</code> <code>2</code></td>
<td><code>1 * 2</code> <code>*</code> <code>3</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The number of inputs our algorithm is able to generate increases exponentially with the number of
user-supplied examples. And in cases where longer input strings are desired, we can feed
automatically-generated inputs back into the algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="a-more-scalable-visualization">A More Scalable Visualization</h3>
<p>While the Ohm Editor’s current visualization (described in
<a href="#visualizer">Section 3</a>) works well for small inputs, it does not scale well to
larger inputs that span multiple lines. Below is a prototype of a new visualization that was
designed for scalability:</p>
<video controls>
  <source src="media/sakeths-viz.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>This new visualization preserves the structure of the input (e.g., its indentation) to make it
easier for the programmer to understand the connection between the text and its decomposition.
Colored lines mark the boundaries of CST nodes in the text of the input. If a node spans more than
one line of text, its children’s annotations are drawn vertically to the left of the input.
Otherwise, the node’s annotation is drawn horizontally below its text.  (These horizontal
annotations are only displayed for the line that has focus.) The hue of each line is determined by
the position of its associated rule in the grammar, allowing the user to quickly recognize patterns
in the decomposition of the input.</p>
<h2 id="6-conclusions-and-future-work">6. Conclusions and Future Work</h2>
<p>We have outlined several ways in which principles from live programming could make the life of the
“language hacker” easier. We have also demonstrated the application of these principles in the Ohm
Editor, a tool we are building to support our new language implementation framework. We believe
these ideas are equally applicable to other grammar-based language development tools.</p>
<p>While we are encouraged by the results presented in this paper, there is still much work to be
done. For example, when the programmer adds or modifies a semantic action through a particular CST
node, the Ohm editor automatically evaluates that semantic action <em>for that particular node</em>. It
may be more helpful to instead evaluate that semantic action for <em>all</em> nodes of that type. This
should reduce the number of “clunky” interactions in our UI (e.g., the manual “force evaluation”
feature) and present as much potentially useful information to the programmer as possible, by
default.</p>
<p>We also plan to explore different ways to display the results of semantic actions. Displaying
them as strings inside CST nodes, as we do now, is clearly not appropriate for many applications.
It should be possible for the programmer to specify custom “result visualizations” for their
operations and attributes, when desired.</p>
<!--
* provide a "global view" of the semantic actions for an operation, perhaps overlayed on
  top of the grammar. (this would look like OMeta, without sacrificing Ohm's modularity.)
